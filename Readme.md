# Automated Dataset Cleaning & ML Visualization Web App

An interactive **machine learning & data visualization web application** built with **Python and Streamlit** that allows users to upload datasets, clean data automatically, train ML models, and explore insights using **2D and 3D visualizations**.

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **model understanding**, not on prediction generation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload any CSV dataset
- Automatic data cleaning:
  - Handling missing values
  - Basic preprocessing
- Select target column
- Choose problem type:
  - Classification
  - Regression
- Select machine learning model:
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
- Train model on cleaned data
- Visualize insights using:
  - 2D charts (scatter, distribution, comparisons)
  - 3D interactive visualizations
- Simple and user-friendly web interface

## 🧠 Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project is to help users:

- Understand their datasets visually
- Explore feature relationships
- Analyze data before deploying ML models
- Learn machine learning workflows without writing code

This makes the app useful for **students, beginners, and rapid data exploration**.
